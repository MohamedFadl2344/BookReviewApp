BookReviewApp
Welcome to the Online Book Review Server-Side Application, the final project for the IBM Course "Developing back-end apps with Node.js and Express." This application allows users to manage books, write reviews, and interact with book-related data. It utilizes MySQL as the database and Sequelize.js as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.
